# My B2C samples

## Dev environment setup

### Software tools
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). **Recommendation:** Set *File->Auto Save* to *On* in Visual Studio Code
- [B2C Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzureADB2CTools.aadb2c)
- [PowerShell 7.x](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/it-ops-talk/how-to-install-powershell-7)
- [IefPolicies](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/IefPolicies/), [documentation](https://github.com/mrochon/IEFPolicies)

### Dev B2C setup
- Register a web app (Token Viewer) with reply url *https://oidcdebugger.com/debug*; allow return of the access and id token in the Authentication tab
- Create a user (*Users->New user->Create user*) with B2C's upn, e.g. *someuser@myb2c.onmicrosoft.com* - useful for experiemnting with MS Graph through the [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge).

### Usage example

1. Open VSCode
2. Select *Terminal->New Terminal*
3. Ensure your PowerShell terminal is using PS 7.x (*$host.Version*)
4. Create a new folder and change to it (e.g. *mkdir myProject; cd myProject*)
4. Enter *New-IefPolicies*
5. Select a starter pack, e.g. *SL* (Social and local accounts)
6. Enter *Connect-IefPolicies <your b2c name; onmicrosoft.com not needed>*
7. Followe displayed instructions to sign in
8. Enter *Import-IefPolicies*
9. The downloaded starter pack will be modified for use in your B2C and uploaded (you can see the modified files in the ./debug folder)
10. Use https://portal.azure.com B2C menus to execute your policies
11. Repeating *import-iefpolicies* will upload policies modified since the last import and any policies depending on it, e.g. modifying the TrustFrameworkBase.xml policy will result in import of all policies since they are all based on that file.
